# Drawing-Based Clothing Recommendation System

## Introduction

In shopping for clothing or accessories, users often have a specific design in mind but struggle to find the right product because they lack a reference image or the appropriate vocabulary. For instance, different types of pullovers may be challenging to identify without knowing their exact names. To address this, our project introduces a design drawing feature aimed at enhancing user experience on platforms like Myntra. Users can draw their desired clothing or accessory using digital design tools, making shopping more accessible to a wider audience.

## Implementation Model

### User Interface and Drawing Integration

The frontend utilizes HTML5 Canvas for drawing capabilities, providing an intuitive interface for users to sketch their desired products directly on the web platform.

### Backend Development

Powered by Node.js and Express, the backend manages image uploads, processes drawings using image processing libraries (such as OpenCV or TensorFlow), and retrieves product recommendations based on analyzed color data.

### Machine Learning

The system employs machine learning algorithms to analyze color patterns in user drawings, determining potential matches from a product database.

### Database Management

MongoDB serves as the database management system, storing user preferences, product metadata, and drawing analysis results for efficient retrieval and recommendation generation.

### Social Good and Impact

By simplifying the search process for specific clothing designs, our project aims to enhance user satisfaction and accessibility in online shopping, particularly for complex clothing types that are challenging to describe.

### Deployment

The application is deployed using cloud services like AWS or Heroku, ensuring scalability and reliability for handling user interactions and data processing.

### User Feedback

Initial feedback from users indicates improved ease of use and satisfaction in finding desired clothing items, validating the utility and effectiveness of our drawing-based recommendation system.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the provided documentation.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Machine Learning Models**: Integrate advanced models for better drawing analysis and recommendation accuracy.
- **Expanded Product Database**: Include a broader range of clothing types and accessories for more comprehensive recommendations.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Continuously incorporate user feedback to refine and improve the recommendation system.
